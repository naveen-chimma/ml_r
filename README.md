# Insurance Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for insurance charges based on individual attributes. This involves implementing regression techniques, evaluating model performance, and identifying key factors influencing insurance costs.This project analyzes an insurance dataset to predict costs using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to predict insurance costs based on customer features, including demographic and health-related attributes. The project explores various machine learning models to achieve the best predictive accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **age:** Age of the policyholder.
- **sex:** Gender of the policyholder.
- **bmi:** Body mass index.
- **children:** Number of children covered by insurance.
- **smoker:** Whether the policyholder is a smoker.
- **region:** Residential region of the policyholder.
- **charges:** Insurance cost (target variable).

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values:** Checked and managed missing data.
2. **Validation:** Verified data integrity using pandas' `unique` method.
3. **Encoding Categorical Data:** Applied encoding for `sex`, `smoker`, and `region` columns.
4. **Scaling:** Standardized numerical features using normalization techniques.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized data distributions and correlations.
- Identified trends between features and the target variable.

## Model Development

- Implemented machine learning models for prediction:
  - Linear Regression
  - Regularized Regression (Lasso and Ridge)
- Evaluated models using metrics such as R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Results

- Achieved **R² Score:** 0.089 (train), 0.029 (test).
- MSE on test set: 989,558,744.54.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and regularization in predicting insurance costs. Future work could include:
- Exploring advanced algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
- Incorporating additional features for better predictive power.
